> Flemzerd is an automation tool (like a very lightweight Sonarr) for handling TV Shows.
> It watches your tv shows for new episodes, downloads them in the client of your choices, and updates your media center library if needed.


Flemzerd is a daemon intended to track and handle your media library. We are often doing the same thing by hand: 
* Look regularly for new episodes of tv show
* Once an episode is available, look for a way to download it
* Launch download in your download client and wait for the download to end
* Move the episode wherever you store your media and manually update your media center (refresh Kodi library for example)

Flemzerd is intended to automate these tasks.
